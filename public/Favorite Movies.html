    <h2>The Best Movies I've Ever Seen</h2>
<hr/>

        <h3>The Fall</h3>
             <p>The colors, the locations, the costumes, 
                the acting - in every way this movie was just 
                an aboslute masterpiece of cinema that is 
                severely underrated and always in 
                recommendation list.</p>

        <h3>Muppet Treasure Island</h3>
            <p>The best Muppet movie they ever made. Fight me 
                about it. Brian Henson's era of the Muppets is
                severly overlooked by purists. <br>
                Rizzo and Gonzo for liiiiife!!!</p> 

        <h3>Promising Young Woman</h3>
            <p>I'm biased because I worked on it. But stylistically
                it's daring, Mulligan's acting is amazing, and
                the first time I read the script I was emotionally
                shaken by the ending.</p>
