<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Dan's been learning to code since this past Friday.</p>

<p>Right now he's making some very basic html websites to follow along in his lessons from Dr. Angela Yu.</p>

<p>The rest of this is really just filler except for the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Testing out unordered lists</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Testing out ordered lists</li>
    <li>Looks like it's working!</li>
  </ol>
